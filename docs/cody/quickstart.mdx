# Cody Quickstart

<p className="subtitle">This quickstart guide shows how to use Cody in the VS Code editor. You'll learn about the following three tasks:</p>

1. Chat with Cody to write code snippets
2. Use Cody to execute inline edits
3. Use Cody to debug code and ask Cody to fix bugs

<Callout type="info">There are [many ways to use Cody](/cody/clients). For this guide, we'll be using the [VS Code](/cody/clients/install-vscode) extension.</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need the following:

- [Cody extension installed](/cody/clients/install-vscode) in your VS Code editor
- Free or Pro account via Sourcegraph.com or a Sourcegraph Enterprise account
- A project open in VS Code

## Getting started with the Cody

After installing the extension and connecting to a Sourcegraph instance, you can leverage Cody to use the best LLM and context to understand, write, and fix code. Click the **Cody** icon from the VS Code side activity bar to open the Cody chat panel.

By default, the chat input will have the context of your entire codebase, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet is selected as the default chat model. Based on your [Cody tier](https://sourcegraph.com/pricing?product=cody), you can change the LLM model and context based on your use case to optimize for speed, accuracy, or cost.

To help you automate your key tasks in your development workflow you get **[Prompts](/cody/capabilities/commands)**. If you are a part of an organization on Sourcegraph.com or a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance, you can view these pre-built Prompts created by your teammates. On the contrary, you can create your own Prompts via the **Prompt Library** from your Sourcegraph instance.

There a few more options and settings that you can explore in the Cody chat interface. [You can read more in these docs](/cody/capabilities/chat).

## Working with the Cody extension

Let's create a JavaScript function that converts a `given date` into a human-readable description of the time elapsed between the `given date` and the `current date`. This example uses a starter boilerplate code that helps you set up and run three tasks with the Cody VS Code extension.

Here's the code for the date elapsed function:

```js
function getTimeAgoDescription(dateString) {
	const startDate = new Date(dateString);
	const currentDate = new Date();

	const years = currentDate.getFullYear() - startDate.getFullYear();
	const months = currentDate.getMonth() - startDate.getMonth();
	const days = currentDate.getDate() - startDate.getDate();

	let timeAgoDescription = '';

	if (years > 0) {
		timeAgoDescription += `${years} ${years === 1 ? 'year' : 'years'}`;
	}

	if (months > 0) {
		if (timeAgoDescription !== '') {
			timeAgoDescription += ' ';
		}
		timeAgoDescription += `${months} ${months === 1 ? 'month' : 'months'}`;
	}

	if (days > 0) {
		if (timeAgoDescription !== '') {
			timeAgoDescription += ' ';
		}
		timeAgoDescription += `${days} ${days === 1 ? 'day' : 'days'}`;
	}

	if (timeAgoDescription === '') {
		timeAgoDescription = 'today';
	} else {
		timeAgoDescription += ' ago';
	}

	return timeAgoDescription;
}
```

## 1. Generate a unit test

To ensure code quality and early bug detection, one of the most useful commands that Cody offers is **Generate unit tests**. It quickly helps you write test code for any snippet that you have highlighted. To generate a unit test for our example function:

- Open the `date.js` file in VS Code
- Highlight a code snippet that you'd like to test
- Inside Cody chat, type `/test` or press the command hotkey (`âŒ¥` + `c` / `alt` + `c`)
- Select `Generate unit tests` option and hit `Enter`

Cody will help you generate the following unit test in the sidebar:

```js
import assert from 'assert';
import { getTimeAgoDescription } from '../src/date.js';

describe('getTimeAgoDescription', () => {
	it('returns correct relative time for date 1 month ago', () => {
		const oneMonthAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString().split('T')[0];
		const result = getTimeAgoDescription(oneMonthAgo);
		assert.equal(result, '1 month ago');
	});

	it('returns correct relative time for date 2 months ago', () => {
		const twoMonthsAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 2 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString().split('T')[0];
		const result = getTimeAgoDescription(twoMonthsAgo);
		assert.equal(result, '2 months ago');
	});
});

```

This unit test file tests the `getTimeAgoDescription()` function from the `date.js` file. These tests help you validate that the `getTimeAgoDescription()` function correctly returns the relative time descriptions for dates in the past. The tests generate specific sample input dates and confirm that the output matches the expected result.

## 2. Suggest bug fixes and changes to code snippets

Cody is very efficient at catching bugs and suggesting improvements to code snippets. To try this out, let's run our previously generated unit test and see if Cody notices any issues. Inside your VS Code terminal, run the following command to try the unit test:

```bash
node tests/test.js
```

This results in an error, as our function does not identify the `describe` statement.

Let's paste this error into the Cody chat and see what suggestions it provides:

![Example of error debugging with Cody ](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/cody-quickstart/debug-with-cody.png)

Leveraging the failed test output, Cody is able to identify the potential bug and suggest a fix. It recommends installing `mocha`, importing it at the top of the `test.js` file to identify `describe`, and finally running it with `mocha`.

## 3. Ask Cody to add code documentation

Cody can also create well-crafted code documentation and comments, significantly improving the readability experience.
You can add it by selecting a code snippet and running the **Document** command. Cody will add a comment to the top of the code snippet.

## Try other commands and Cody chat

That's it for this quickstart guide! Feel free to continue chatting with Cody to learn more about its [capabilities](/cody/capabilities). Cody can run some other useful commands including:

- Explain code snippets
- Refactor code and variable names
- Translate code to different languages
- Answer general questions about your code
- Write context-aware code with a general awareness of the broader codebase
